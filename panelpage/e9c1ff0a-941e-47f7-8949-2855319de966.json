The total fiber content could be around 40-50 grams. \n* Calcium: Cheese is a good source of calcium, and vegetables also provide some. The total calcium content could be roughly 1,500-2,000 milligrams. \n* Iron: Lentils and sun-dried tomatoes are good sources of iron. The total iron content could be around 15-20 milligrams. \n* Vitamin C: Tomatoes, broccoli, and cauliflower are high in Vitamin C. The total Vitamin C content could be roughly 100-200 milligrams. \n\nAs for daily allowances, they can vary depending on factors such as age, sex, weight, and activity level. However, here are some general guidelines from the FDA:\n\n* Protein: The daily recommended intake is 50 grams.\n* Fiber: The daily recommended intake is 28 grams.\n* Calcium: The daily recommended intake is 1,300 milligrams.\n* Iron: The daily recommended intake is 18 milligrams.\n* Vitamin C: The daily recommended intake is 90 milligrams for men and 75 milligrams for women.\n\nPlease keep in mind that these are rough estimates and actual values may vary.
